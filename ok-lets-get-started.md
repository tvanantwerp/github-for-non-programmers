## OK, Let's Get Started!

1. Register an account at [GitHub](https://github.com/join).
2. Download and install the [GitHub desktop app](https://desktop.github.com/). *(This guide will assume you're on Windows from here on out--the Mac desktop app may work a bit differently.)*
3. Enter your user info from step 1 into the GitHub desktop app you installed in step 2.

That was pretty painless, right? Let's get ready to practice creating repos, making commits, and working as a team on GitHub!
